1. Provide Big O Notation for each of your solutions
   
   *Insertion sort O(1) because it uses a fixed amount of space an o(n) because it itterates tho the array at least once
   *Reversed linked List  O(n) because it iterates through the list exactly once and O(1) because it is constant

3. Research Quick, Bubble and Insertion sort. Describe which algorithm and how they perform
   
   *Quick sort has a pivot element everything less than the pivot is sorted to the left and everythiing greater is sortred to the right. this is a divide and conquer algorithm.O(n log n) time is linearithmic.

   *Bubble Sort continuously swaps elements that are close to each other that are out of order. O(n^2) time increases quickly as the number of inputs grows

   *Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. O(1) time is constant

4. Research Dijkstra's Algorthim. Describe what problem this algorithm solves and list 2 situations, datasets, or real world applications that the algorithm can be used to solve.

 * This algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single node to all other nodes. This is used in GPS applications and Data transfer across networks.
